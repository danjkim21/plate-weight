## About Plate Calc

WORK IN PROGRESS. Planning to create a simple plate calculator. I hate having to have my calculator app out to figure out what and how many plates to add to the barbell. 

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. <br>


## Lessons Learned:

TBD


## Roadmap

- [ ] Fully draft README
- [x] Functional js plate calculation function
- [ ] Simple UI that displays plates needed to add
- [ ] History of previous weights inputed
- [ ] Local storage implementation of past weights inputed (TBD)
- [ ] Visualization of the barbell and plates needed (TBD)
